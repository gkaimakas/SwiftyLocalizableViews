# SwiftyLocalizableViews

A collection of localizable UIViews from within Interface Builder

## Usage

To use a view from the collection go to the interface builber and change the class name of the view to its localizable equivalent.

Create a Localizable.strings file and add the localized string.

Finally, on the inteface builder you will see the option to set the localized text of the view.

For a very quick example on how to use a localizable view check the example application available with this project. Specifically the Main.storyboard file.
